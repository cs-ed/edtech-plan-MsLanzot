# Educational Technology Plan
This educational technology plan is an outline for teaching AP Computer Science A at Palo Alto High School.

## Context
Palo Alto High School (Paly) is a large public high school across the street from Stanford University. The school is academically high achieving, and the majority of students come from economically stable or affluent homes. Only 7% of students qualfy for free/reduced lunch. 45% of students are White, while 33.5% are Asian, and 12% are Hispanic while only 2% are Black. Paly is a well-resourced school with active and involved parents and a dedicated staff. The district strategic priorities are Mental Health, Service to Others, Early Literacy, Equity, and Healthy Attendance. This is my first year teaching at Paly. 

### Course
The course I teach and for which I have formulated this plan is AP Computer Science A, which is a year-long introductory course in Java. 
This year I have 90 students, from 10th to 12 graders in each of my three sections. We are in-person, learning in the classroom and have been since August.
There are three CS courses available this year at Paly: AP Computer Science Principles, Functional & Object Oriented Programming, and AP Computer Science A. 
AP CS Capstone and Web Development are also in the course catalog, but this year neither of those courses is being offered. 
As per the College Board, AP Computer Science A has 10 units of Study:

  1. Primitive Types
  2. Using Objects
  3. Boolean Expressions & if Statements
  4. Iteration
  5. Writing Classes
  6. Array
  7. ArrayList
  8. 2D Array
  9. Inheritance
  10. Recursion

The course is also organized around four big ideas:

*"**Modularity**: Modularity in object-oriented programming allows us
to use abstraction to break complex programs down into
individual classes and methods."
*"**Variables**: Variables create data abstractions, as they can
represent a set of possible values or a group of related values."
*"**Control**: Doing things in order, making decisions, and doing the
same process multiple times are represented in code by using
control structures."
*"**Impact of Computing**: Computers and computing have
revolutionized our lives. To use computing safely and responsibly,
we need to be aware of privacy, security, and ethical issues."

### Situation

Paly CS students are quite diverse in their ability level and comfort with Java. I have some students who are already Java proficient, and some students who are absolute beginners. Most students are somewhere in between, and the majority of my students have either taken AP CS Principles or have experience coding in another language (typically Python or C++) prior to enrolling in AP CS A. Most students bring their own personal laptop to class, though a significant percentage (roughlly 30%) use a district-provided Chromebook that they take home and bring to school each day.
The majority of my students are Asian males. None of my students have limited English proficiency, through I do have a student with a 504 related to reading difficulties. A handful of students have 504s related to anxiety/depression and/or ADD/ADHD.  Many of my students have at least one parent who works in high-tech and/or has a CS education.
There are no computers in my classroom for student use as students are expected to bring their device to class each day.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

#### Student Software
Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

**CSAwesome**: Students will use CSAwesome as their online textbook and for auto-graded problets. This allows me to easily grade and track what work students have done and what topics or questions are most challenging for them.

**CodeHS**: Students will use CodeHS to complete the College Board approved labs since all files required are preloaded in the online IDE and most bugs have been fixed.

**Coding Rooms**: Students will use Coding Rooms as their online IDE for labs and other assignments I assign since it allws me to easily see/run their code and provide feedback. 

**AP Classroom**: Run by the College Board, the AP Classroom website has a library of videos, assessments, and practice test questions as well as practice Free Response Questions students can use to help prepare for the AP Exam in May.

#### Teacher Software

**Schoology**: Schoology is the district's chosen LMS which I use to assign work, enter grades, and provide feedback to students and parents.

**CSAwesome, CodeHS, Coding Rooms, & AP Classroom**: I will also use these sites to manage student assignments, track student progress, and provide feedback.

**Google Slides**: I use Google Slides to create slidedecks which I present to students during class lectures and discussion.

**PearDeck**:  I use PearDeck which is an add-on to Google Slides that allows me to build in questions, prompts, and other visual feedback elements into my slides so that in real-time, during class, mid-lecture, I can have students respond via PearDeck and quickly get a snapshot of student understanding during class.

### Hardware Specifications

Students are required to bring a laptop, Chromebook or iPad to class each day with a charger. Since there are so many different personal devices brought to class each day, I have no specific hardward requirements. The device they bring to class must be able to wirelessly access the internet and I strongly encourage the use of the Chrome browser since most of the websites we use during class simply work better on Chrome. 

Students who are using a district provided Chromebook are on a machine with the following specs:

-ASUS Chromebook
-Intel Celeron N3350 Processsor
-32GB Sotrage Space (eMMC Storage)
-4GB RAM (LPDDR4 RAM)
-Integrated Graphics Card
-Chrome Operating System


### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
