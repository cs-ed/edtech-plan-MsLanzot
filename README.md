# Educational Technology Plan
This educational technology plan is an outline for teaching AP Computer Science A at Palo Alto High School.

## Context
Palo Alto High School (Paly) is a large public high school across the street from Stanford University. The school is academically high achieving, and the majority of students come from economically stable or affluent homes. Only 7% of students qualfy for free/reduced lunch. 45% of students are White, while 33.5% are Asian, and 12% are Hispanic while only 2% are Black. Paly is a well-resourced school with active and involved parents and a dedicated staff. The district strategic priorities are Mental Health, Service to Others, Early Literacy, Equity, and Healthy Attendance. This is my first year teaching at Paly. 

### Course
The course I teach and for which I have formulated this plan is AP Computer Science A, which is a year-long introductory course in Java. 
This year I have 90 students, from 10th to 12 graders in each of my three sections. We are in-person, learning in the classroom and have been since August.
There are three CS courses available this year at Paly: AP Computer Science Principles, Functional & Object Oriented Programming, and AP Computer Science A. 
AP CS Capstone and Web Development are also in the course catalog, but this year neither of those courses is being offered. 
As per the College Board, AP Computer Science A has 10 units of Study:

  1. Primitive Types
  2. Using Objects
  3. Boolean Expressions & if Statements
  4. Iteration
  5. Writing Classes
  6. Array
  7. ArrayList
  8. 2D Array
  9. Inheritance
  10. Recursion

The course is also organized around four big ideas:

  -"**Modularity**: Modularity in object-oriented programming allows us
to use abstraction to break complex programs down into
individual classes and methods."

  -"**Variables**: Variables create data abstractions, as they can
represent a set of possible values or a group of related values."

  -"**Control**: Doing things in order, making decisions, and doing the
same process multiple times are represented in code by using
control structures."

  -"**Impact of Computing**: Computers and computing have
revolutionized our lives. To use computing safely and responsibly,
we need to be aware of privacy, security, and ethical issues."

### Situation

Paly CS students are quite diverse in their ability level and comfort with Java. I have some students who are already Java proficient, and some students who are absolute beginners. Most students are somewhere in between, and the majority of my students have either taken AP CS Principles or have experience coding in another language (typically Python or C++) prior to enrolling in AP CS A. Most students bring their own personal laptop to class, though a significant percentage (roughlly 30%) use a district-provided Chromebook that they take home and bring to school each day.
The majority of my students are Asian males. None of my students have limited English proficiency, through I do have a student with a 504 related to reading difficulties. A handful of students have 504s related to anxiety/depression and/or ADD/ADHD.  Many of my students have at least one parent who works in high-tech and/or has a CS education.
There are no computers in my classroom for student use as students are expected to bring their device to class each day.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

#### Student Software
Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

**CSAwesome**: Students will use CSAwesome as their online textbook and for auto-graded problets. This allows me to easily grade and track what work students have done and what topics or questions are most challenging for them.

**CodeHS**: Students will use CodeHS to complete the College Board approved labs since all files required are preloaded in the online IDE and most bugs have been fixed.

**Coding Rooms**: Students will use Coding Rooms as their online IDE for labs and other assignments I assign since it allws me to easily see/run their code and provide feedback. 

**AP Classroom**: Run by the College Board, the AP Classroom website has a library of videos, assessments, and practice test questions as well as practice Free Response Questions students can use to help prepare for the AP Exam in May.

#### Teacher Software

**Schoology**: Schoology is the district's chosen LMS which I use to assign work, enter grades, and provide feedback to students and parents.

**CSAwesome, CodeHS, Coding Rooms, & AP Classroom**: I will also use these sites to manage student assignments, track student progress, and provide feedback.

**Google Slides**: I use Google Slides to create slidedecks which I present to students during class lectures and discussion.

**PearDeck**:  I use PearDeck which is an add-on to Google Slides that allows me to build in questions, prompts, and other visual feedback elements into my slides so that in real-time, during class, mid-lecture, I can have students respond via PearDeck and quickly get a snapshot of student understanding during class.

### Hardware Specifications

Students are required to bring a laptop, Chromebook or iPad to class each day with a charger. Since there are so many different personal devices brought to class each day, I have no specific hardware requirements. The device they bring to class must be able to wirelessly access the internet and I strongly encourage the use of the Chrome browser since most of the websites we use during class simply work better on Chrome. 

Students who are using a district provided Chromebook are on a machine with the following specs:

   -ASUS Chromebook
   
   -Intel Celeron N3350 Processsor
   
   -32GB Sotrage Space (eMMC Storage)
   
   -4GB RAM (LPDDR4 RAM)
   
   -Integrated Graphics Card
   
   -Chrome Operating System
   
Teacher Hardware includes MacBook Laptop & an LCD Projector:
 
    -MacBook Air (M1)
  
    -251 GB Hard Drive
    
    -8 GB RAM
    
    -Running Mac OS 11.6 (Big Sur)
    
All classrooms and outdoor spaces on campus have access to the district's WiFi network in order to access the internet.

### Application

The structure of the class roughly follows the following pattern.

Each unit is divided into sections. For each section I give a brief lecture using Google slides to provide a visual component for the concepts being covered orally in the lecture. The slides I use are adapted from a more experienced CS teacher who took the time to carefully format the code snippets and text on the slides to help make the information clearer and reduce the cognitive load for students by applying the Signaling Principle to help direct student attention to what is most important. Lecture also applies the Redundancy Principle by complementing the slide visuals with the auditory component of narrating the important content I want students to learn.

After the lecture, students are assigned the corresponding section in our CSAwesome textbook to read, make sense of, take notes on and complete problets in which are auto-graded to provide the student with immediate feedback. The textbook is interactive and often incorporates YouTube videos, word-matching problems, multiple-choice questions, and mixed-up code practice in the text. These built-in checks for understanding help students stay engaged and give them a sense of how well they are understanding the content. During this time they can get help from me or from a peer, and collaboration is highly encouraged so that students don't feel alone if they get stuck on anything. I also monitor the room, checking in on students of concern during this time. The textbook makes use of the Segmentation Principle to break content into smaller segments and chunks that students can make sense of.

Each section of CSAwesome ends with a Programming Challenge which is typically assigned as a Pair Programming experience. I encourage students to work together on the Programming Challenge and have paired them strategically so that my absolute beinners are always paired with someone who has more experience coding, and my most advanced programming students are paired with students who have at least some coding experience, so that the ability gap between partners is not unreasonably wide. Peer instruction occurs during the collaboration on the Programming Challenge which helps both students grow their understanding of Java while at the same time building a classroom community that is inclusive and collaborative.

About midway through each unit we typically complete a Progress Check on the AP Classroom website which gives me and the students immediate feedback on how they are progressing in their understanding of the current unit measured by their ability to correclty answer practice AP Test questions on the content learned so far. Once these formative assessments are completed, I typically make a PearDeck of the questions that proved to be most challenging for my students. We then revisit them again in class, this time in pairs of two to analyze the code presented and discuss with a partner which answer they believe is correct. This allows for rich discussions to occur in class and for me to attempt to eliminate any remaining misconceptions or misunderstandings. 

I sometimes use Coding Rooms to demo how a piece of code works (or doesn't) and ask students to debug or make suggestions about how we might fix a piece of code. Coding Rooms allows me to write code and have students be able to see it on their own laptop screens. They can also copy/paste the code I show them into their own workspace in Coding Rooms and manipulate or save it for future reference. The use of Coding Rooms to help students learn how to analyze and debug code engages students by having them be active learners -- discussing why code works or deoesn't, and discovering how to fix a piece of code by writing or fixing code will help them grow their confidence and understanding as Java programmers.

At the end of each unit before the unit test I prepare another PearDeck of challenging/relevant questions which we tackle in teams of two, then discuss as a whole class. The Unit test is taken as a paper/pencil test individually and graded by me, but students are allowed to do test corrections where they can earn points back by writing about why their choice was incorrect, justify what the correct answer is, and why all the other choices are incorrect. This practice is designed to be inclusive -- CS is hard and beginners are going to make a lot of mistakes, but they can improve their grade by taking the time and putting in the effort to analyze their mistakes and do the test corrections. 

Finally, we have only done one of the College Board approved labs so far, but using CodeHS to complete it was convenient and made it easy for students to access the files and the instructions all in one place. It also allows me to easily give feedback about their code. Students complete the labs in teams of two and only one person submits the code, though there is a written component where they answer questions about the lab. I use Coding Rooms for all other labs since I can easily customize the instructions and requirements as well as set the auto-grader requirements. Coding Rooms has more features that I am not currently taking advantage of but I am hoping to get some training on Coding Rooms in the coming months in order to learn how best to use more of its features.

### Impacts

One guiding principle for me when choosing tools was that they had to be accessible for students who were issued a district-provided Chromebook, meaning that there could be no product we would use that would require students to install software on their own machine. Everything is web-based to insure that students who are on district-provided chromebooks are not at a disadvantage to students who have their own laptop. This also provides flexibility for students if they need to be absent or need to quarantine due to COVID, or if we ever need to return to distance-learning.

In terms of partner work, I do a lot to encourage collaboration and to make partnerships that work. I often pair female students with other females that I think will work well together. Females are a minority in my classroom and I want to encorage them to continue their studies in CS. For all of my students, I try to build relationships with each of them and build trust so that I can partner them with students who will make a good match and so that they feel comfortable asking for help whenever they need it.

PearDeck helps me identify the students who are stuggling while annonymizing the data when displayed in front of the class. It allows for me to pose questions and see all student responses in real time. After class (or once the PearDeck presentation is over and students are working on another task) I can look inside the spreadsheet generated or at the teacher page and see which students entered what responses, and reach out to students who are confused or struggling and offer support.

Coding Rooms allows me to demo coding skills and easily share code with my students. Plagiarism can be an issue though, and Coding Rooms has a copy/paste detector for the work students submit. While it is not perfect, it is a place to start a conversation with a student about why their code has been copy/pasted and the ethical way to collaborate and get help versus old-fashioned copying.

Finally, CodeHS has helped me administer the College Board approved labs since all of the files are pre-loaded into the platform and the instructions have been enhanced and are available on the same screen students are coding in. CodeHS also has videos and practice problems that I don't typically assign but that some students take advantage of to do extra practice. 

All of these tools are free, though using CSAwesome required me to set up all student accounts since they would not sign my district's contract ensuring that student PII would be kept confidential. All of my students have a random assigned number and name to keep their PII secure, and each of their accounts was set up with an alias for my email address, so if they forget their password it can be a bit of an inconvenience to reset it, and I use a spreadsheet to manage student account names and numbers so I can associate them with the actual student names so I can accurately enter grades into the gradebook. However, the interactive textbook is so good that it makes this minor inconvenience worth it. My district paid $1000 to buy a Coding Rooms license for the year so that I could have full access to all Coding Rooms features with my students, but otherwise all of the tools I am using are free for me and my students to use.

It is important that all required tech tools in an Intro CS class are accessible to all students regardless of their device. It is also important that we are providing access to the content in visual and auditory ways, reducing the cognitive load as much as possible, and streamlining/simplifying the presentation of material whenever possible. I use my slides to do this, as well as code demos using coding rooms, and PearDeck checks for understanding. The autograded problets on CSAwesome help students know right away when they are confused or incorrectly answering a question so that misconceptions can be addressed immediately.

So far I feel like the tech tools I have chosen for this year are working pretty well. The one area where I am struggling is how to efficiently and effectively grade free response questions, which are handwritten and open-eneded. As a Java beginner myself, it has proven exceptionally difficult for me to grade practice FRQs since the process is time-consuming and students come up with all kinds of solutions, some of which I am not familiar with yet. I need to reach out to my network of fellow AP CS teachers and ask how others have tackled this problem to get some ideas about how to improve assessing FRQs.
